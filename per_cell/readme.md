welcome to the "per_cell" folder! 

this has all of the nutrient, chla, and lipid data normalized to number of cells in the pellet **instead of to the total volume of cells in the pellet**

the .Rmd output is for anyone who wants to see that doing the aforementioned normalizations produces similar trends and statistics to that of the main manuscript (normalizes to volume of cells used to harvest). The .Rmd output is pretty drafty in the sense that the axes text (units!!!) haven't been tweaked in illustrator. Feel free to reach out with any questions - hgreich16 [at] gmail [dot] com
